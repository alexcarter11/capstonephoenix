        <p>At Capstone Phoenix, we’re all about making your home better with top-quality <a href="https://capstonephoenix.com/">window and door replacements</a>. Based in Phoenix, AZ, at 5448 E Washington St #5, our team, led by Adam Johnson, has been serving Arizona homeowners for over 15 years. We know how hot Phoenix summers can get, and we design windows and doors that keep your home cool, save energy, and look great.</p>
        <p>Our mission is simple: help families live comfortably while adding style to their homes. For example, we worked with a family in Scottsdale who wanted new windows to cut their energy bills. After installing our double-pane sliding windows, they saved $200 in just three months! We’re proud to be part of the Phoenix community, helping neighbors in Mesa, Chandler, and beyond make their homes more beautiful and efficient.</p>
        <p>We focus on quality and trust. Every window and door we install is built to last in Arizona’s tough climate.

        <h2>Our Window Replacement Services</h2>
        <p>Windows do more than just let in light—they can save you money, keep your home cool, and boost its style. At Capstone Phoenix, we offer six types of windows to fit any home. Each type is designed to handle Arizona’s heat while making your home look amazing. Here’s what we offer:</p>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Sliding Windows</h3>
                <p>These windows slide open easily and are great for big views. They’re perfect for living rooms or bedrooms where you want lots of light and airflow. Our sliding windows come with double-pane glass to keep heat out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Double Hung Windows</h3>
                <p>Classic and versatile, these windows have two parts that slide up and down. They’re easy to clean and great for air circulation, especially in hot Phoenix summers. A Mesa family told us their new double-hung windows made their home feel fresher!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Awning Windows</h3>
                <p>These windows open from the top, letting you keep them open even during rain. They’re perfect for bathrooms or kitchens where you need ventilation without worrying about water. We installed awning windows for a Chandler home, and they loved the extra breeze.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Casement Windows</h3>
                <p>Casement windows swing open like a door, giving you maximum airflow. They’re great for kitchens or bedrooms where you want fresh air. Our uPVC casement windows are low-maintenance and energy-efficient, perfect for Glendale homes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Picture Windows</h3>
                <p>Fixed windows that don’t open but offer huge, clear views. They’re perfect for showing off Arizona’s desert scenery. A Fountain Hills client chose our energy-efficient picture windows and said their living room feels brighter and cooler.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Specialty Windows</h3>
                <p>Want something unique? Our specialty windows come in shapes like arches or circles to match your home’s style. We helped a Paradise Valley homeowner add arched windows, and it gave their home a one-of-a-kind look.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Each window type is built to save energy and last for years. For example, our double-pane windows block out heat, which can cut your cooling costs by up to 20%. We also offer custom colors and sizes to match your home’s look, whether it’s modern or traditional.</p>

                <h3>Sliding Glass Doors</h3>
                <p>These doors slide open to save space and let in tons of light. They’re perfect for patios or backyards. A Surprise family we worked with loved how their new sliding glass doors made their outdoor space feel like part of their home.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>French Doors</h3>
                <p>Elegant and timeless, French doors swing open to add charm. They’re great for connecting indoor and outdoor spaces or even as interior doors. We installed French doors for a Cave Creek home, and they said it gave their house a fancy, welcoming vibe.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Specialty Doors</h3>
                <p>Need something different? Our specialty doors include unique designs like custom interior doors or bold front doors. A Gilbert homeowner chose a specialty door with carved patterns, and it became the talk of their neighborhood!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Our doors are built to handle Arizona’s heat and dust while keeping your home secure. For example, our sliding glass doors have strong locks and energy-efficient glass to keep your home safe and cool. We also offer screen door options for extra airflow without bugs.</p>
